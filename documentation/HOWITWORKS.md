# How it works ?

## When are the items updated ?

> The items are not updated all the time. They are updated when :
- a player run the **/fix-attributes** command with the item in the hand.
- an **enchantment book** is applied in an **anvil**.
- an **enchantment** is applied in an **enchantment table**.*
- the item is given by **a moderator who used /ei give** command or the **EI Editor menu** 
*(if the activator EI_ENTER_IN_THE_PLAYER_INVENTORY is activated)*

### Does this apply to all items ?

> **NO. It only works for custom items.**  
> ⚠️ A custom item is an item which **has attribute modifiers** (for example +2 speed)

> If this condition is met, the item will be updated 
> during previously announced events.   
> You can test the presence of these conditions 
> with the **/fix-attributes command**.
